does anything have meaning in the least form? why would we all be existing just to suffocate in this meaningless flow of life? what is the point of existing if everything that human being does proves nothing, it benefits no things to them or others, it just makes their existence rarely slightly easier or in most cases just harder. speaking of existence - what is it? does can it be explained? does it mean anything besides just be in this form in this place? what does everything mean? why did humanity achieve so much? why do we do our tasks daily, if we could just stop? what would happen if we stopped? collapse? catastrophies? what? it doesn't even matter. it has no meaning. we would continue to exist, just executing another tasks, just living another lives. no, we certainly wouldn't die, no one here sits and talks about deaths, death is something that is inavoidable, we can't run from it, we can't hide from it, we can just stop and wait. but before death comes life, and the main purpose of life is to do things that reward you with funds that you can use to continue living your life. why? why live? what's the purpose of life? why we, so bright and clever creatures live? it doesn't serve any purpose. it just drags you into endless funnel of meaningless tasks you complete to  have no benefit other than only you imagine, until that funnel breaks and death comes. and when death comes - you stop existing. of course, your body is still there, your possessions are still there, but you yourself - the mind that operates those - aren't. and isn't it meaningless? you know you can't do anything about it, you know it's not your fault not being able to change it, yet you still live, you still do things to earn that reward that won't even matter tommorow as of today. do you remember what happened yesterday at exactly 20:32:42.529? if you're so specific with your memory and you do remember, answer this: was it important more than, let's say, simply counting one through ten? was it? if so, how much more important was it? how was it more important? why would one thing be more important than other, if both of those things are done by superbeing that can achieve so mind-blowing goals, yet still does things that they have to do, that they are "forced" to do? that is the point - prioritazation is the most meaningless concept that humanity executes. no one is forced to do anything, they can do whatever they want, they can do it whenever and however they want, and they still exist living routines from day to day just to continue existing repeating that same thing over and over untill they burn out and do unreversible. and what is the result? is it that big of achievement? is it that big of their part of life? no, it doesn't mean anything, it serves no purpose other than just wasting resources. anything doesn't serve purpose other than wasting resources. and resources are limited, and soon everything will end. the question is not what is the purpose of life, it's how much time does life have left.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
